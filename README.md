# Any Given Sunday 🏈

Probabilistic NFL game predictions with a transparent, reproducible pipeline.
Built with Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn, and PostgreSQL — deployed on cloud infra (Render/Railway).

## 🚀 Features (planned)

- Automated ingestion of NFL game data
- Feature engineering (team form, rolling stats, home/away, rest days)
- Machine learning model (baseline logistic regression → gradient boosting upgrade path)
- FastAPI service with `/predict` and `/health` endpoints
- PostgreSQL backend for features, predictions, and API logs
- Optional Streamlit demo frontend
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, and unit tests
